"What is energy benchmarking and why is it important to the District?","Energy benchmarking means tracking a building’s energy and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building’s performance against past performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy and water efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values.<br>The District’s Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 (CAEA) requires that owners of all large private, commercial, and multifamily buildings (over 50,000 gross square feet) annually benchmark their energy and water efficiency and report the results to DOEE for public disclosure. The District government also must annually benchmark and disclose the energy and water efficiency of District government buildings over 10,000 gross square feet. Benchmarking is done using ENERGY STAR ® Portfolio Manager, the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) free, industry-standard online tool. Final regulations were published in January 2013."
"What is the purpose of the Energy Benchmarking DC map interface?","Each year, the District of Columbia publishes detailed energy and water performance benchmarking data from the largest buildings in the city. Data is disclosed beginning with the second year of data for a building. In 2017, DOEE took on a new initiative to transform the disclosure of this information from raw data spreadsheets to a visualization tool that better tells the story of what energy usage in the District’s buildings looks like. The raw data files will remain available on DOEE’s website here: <a href='https://doee.dc.gov/page/energy-benchmarking-disclosure' target='_blank'>doee.dc.gov/page/energy-benchmarking-disclosure</a>."
"Does this map show the energy usage for all of the District’s buildings?","DOEE’s benchmarking law only applies to privately-owned commercial and multifamily properties over 50,000 gross square feet and District-owned properties over 10,000 gross square feet. Owners of buildings under these thresholds can voluntarily report their energy usage to DOEE, but the map will primarily display the information for the District’s largest commercial and multifamily properties. Buildings owned by the Federal government and international entities are exempt from the benchmarking law and thus their information is not included in this public disclosure. Additionally, single-family residential buildings are also not included in this dataset."
"How do I find a specific building on the map?","There are two ways to find a building on the Energy Benchmarking DC map interface. The first option is to search for a building address in the upper left-hand corner by typing the address in the ""Building Address"" field and hitting Enter on your computer keyboard or touchscreen keypad. The second way to find a building is by zooming in to the area of the District where the building is located, locating the cross street and/or building footprint for the building address, then clicking on the colored dot representing that building and its associated benchmarking data. Note that some large campuses submit a single report for a group of their buildings; in those cases the dot for that campus may not fall within any single building’s footprint.<br>When you click on the colored dot associated with a building, a dialog box will appear to show you the fifteen different data fields associated with that property. Fields for display include the Property Name, Owner of Record, Property Type, Compliance Status, Property Size, Year Built, ENERGY STAR Score, Water Use, etc. The dialog box will not display all fifteen fields as a default. You will need to click ""more details” at the bottom of the dialog box to see all fifteen fields displayed at once for a specific property. You can also collapse the dialog box again by clicking ""less details."""
"Where can I find more information about the data fields and metrics?","For the metrics located in the panel on the left-hand side of the screen, you can click on “More Info” to read more details on how that metric is defined and the source of the data/how it is reported to DOEE. Additionally, DOEE has provided a glossary of terms for this website, which can be accessed by clicking ""Glossary"" at the bottom of the screen."
"Why are the dots on the map in different colors?","The colors of the dots represent the relative scale for the selected metric that you are currently viewing on the map. The metrics are listed on the left-hand side of the screen within the categories of Property Information, Energy Use, Water Use, Energy Performance Metrics, and Greenhouse (GHG) Emissions. For example, the map is colored by the ENERGY STAR score metric by default, and each dot is colored based on where that building’s ENERGY STAR score falls on the color scale for ENERGY STAR score. The buildings with lower ENERGY STAR scores are represented as a red dot, whereas the buildings with higher ENERGY STAR scores are blue."
"The map defaults to ENERGY STAR score as the selected metric. How do I change this?","You can change the metric associated with the color of the dots by selecting a new metric category on the left-hand side of the screen and then selecting the specific metric you would like to view. The categories include: Property Information, Energy Use, Water Use, Energy Performance Metrics, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. The actual metrics available for selection include: Property Size, Year Built, Electricity Use, Natural Gas Use, Water-Based Energy Use, Fuel Oil & Diesel Fuel Use, Water Use, ENERGY STAR score, Site Energy Use Intensity, Source Energy Use Intensity, Total GHG Emissions, and GHG Intensity.<br>After selecting a specific metric, the color of the dots on the map will re-configure to represent the relative color scale associated with that metric. The color scale for the dots is ordered based on the relative efficiency (either energy or water) of the building, with the blue color representing a more efficient building, and red representing a less efficient building. Within these metric selections, you also have the ability to filter the information to see what range of data you wish to view for that specific metric by sliding the scale buttons up or down. For example, if you only wish to see the buildings with ENERGY STAR scores of 25-50 represented on the map, you would select the ENERGY STAR score metric on the left-hand side. You would then move the lower-range slider to 25 and the higher-range slider to 75. The map will adjust accordingly.<br>Note that you can set more than one metric filter at a time. For example, you could take a look at all of the buildings between 10,000 and 20,000 gross square feet that have an ENERGY STAR score between 25-50 by sliding the scales for these metrics in the appropriate place. While multiple filters can be applied at the same time, the color of the dots will reflect the most recent metric you have selected."
"Why do some of the dots appear gray?","All of the dots will display the color of the relative color range scale found within the metric you have selected. However, if a specific property does not contain data for the metric you have selected, the dot associated with that property will appear grayed out. For example, if you have selected ENERGY STAR score as the current display metric, any properties that do not have an ENERGY STAR score will appear as a gray dot on the map. Not all types of properties are eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score."
"What do the data fields at the top of the map represent?","There are four fields that appear at the top of the map: Building address, Ward, Property Type, and Report Status. The Building Address field is a search box where you can search for a specific building address within the benchmarking map.<br>The other three fields for Ward, Property Type, and Report Status allow you to further filter the information that is displayed on the map. You can select each metric by simply clicking on the green button for that field and then choosing the filters you wish to apply from the dropdown that appears. After making your selection in the filter, you can remove the dropdown by either clicking on the field name again or clicking anywhere else on the map or webpage.<br>For example, if you only want to view the properties that are located in Ward 6, then you would select the data field Ward at the top of the screen, uncheck all of the Wards except for Ward 6 in the dropdown, and then either click the data field or click somewhere else on the map to make the dropdown disappear again. Note that these filters work in conjunction with any filters you have applied within the metrics on the left-hand side of the screen. So, if you have the scale for ENERGY STAR score set at 25-50 and then select only Ward 6 from the dropdown at the top of the screen, you will then only see the properties that have an ENERGY STAR score of 25-50 located in Ward 6. You can easily unselect and re-select all filters in the data fields at the top by clicking ""Show All"" or ""Hide All"" from the dropdown. Additionally, you can reset all filters by clicking on ""Reset All"" near the Metric Filters heading on the left-hand side of the screen."
"I thought DOEE had collected several years of benchmarking data. What year(s) of data does the map display?","Currently, the DOEE map includes the calendar year 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 benchmarking data, with the map display defaulting to the most recent set of data. You can switch between the calendar year data by moving the slider in the upper right-hand corner of the screen (located below the city skyline) to the year of data that you wish to view. The map will automatically adjust based on the data year you select."
"What is the building comparison list I see at the bottom of the screen?","The building comparison list (only visible on a desktop or laptop computer screen) allows you to see a list of all properties within the map compared within the metric(s) and filter(s) you have selected, along with the averages for those metrics. For example, if you select ENERGY STAR Score from the metrics from the left-side panel and then Ward 7 from the category filters at the top of the page, the building comparison list will show all properties within the District’s dataset that fit within those criteria and display them in ascending order of their ENERGY STAR score. Additionally, the selected property will display a bar graph that highlights where that property falls within the scale of ENERGY STAR Scores. Clicking on a property in the building comparison list will bring you back up to the map with the dialog box for that property displayed, so that you can view the details for that specific property. When you click additional metric filters, those metrics are added to the building comparison list; up to five metrics can be displayed. You can re-sort the list by clicking on any of the metrics."
"Where can I access the raw data for this map?","You can view and download the raw data for this map by clicking ""Download Data"" at the bottom of the screen. This will bring you to DOEE’s Public Disclosure page, where you will be able to access the benchmarking data for all calendar years in an Excel format."
"What does the ""Report Status"" field at the top of the map represent?","The report status for a property essentially indicates whether a property is currently in compliance with the benchmarking law for the selected calendar year. The map automatically defaults to show you the properties that are currently in compliance, but you can change this to also show properties that are exempt from the benchmarking requirements or for which DOEE has yet to receive a report for that calendar year. Note that the “no report received” designation does not necessarily mean that the property was fined. For more information on whether a property has been fined, please contact the DOEE benchmarking program directly at <a href='mailto:info.benchmark@dc.gov'>info.benchmark@dc.gov</a> or 202-671-3300.<br>Exempt properties are properties that are privately owned, but have been exempt from the benchmarking requirements as per the <a href='https://doee.dc.gov/page/am-i-required-benchmark' target='_blank'>exemption criteria</a> provided in the benchmarking law. Building owners that believe they should be exempt must contact DOEE directly (at <a href='mailto:info.benchmark@dc.gov'>info.benchmark@dc.gov</a>) and request the exemption, and DOEE reviews these requests on a case-by-case basis."
"I own, live or work a building that I believe is over 50,000 square feet and it’s not showing on this map. Why is that?","<p>There are several reasons that a building would not appear on the energy benchmarking map. These reasons include, but are not limited to:</p><ul class='indent list'><li>The building may be exempt from reporting for that specific calendar year.</li><li>DOEE’s square footage records may be incorrect and we believe that the property is under 50,000 gross square feet, when it is actually over the threshold.</li><li>The building may not have reported any information to DOEE and is currently out of compliance.</li></ul><p>If you believe there is a building missing from the map, please contact DOEE’s benchmarking program directly at <a href='mailto:info.benchmark@dc.gov'>info.benchmark@dc.gov</a> or 202-671-3300 for more information.</p>"
"I’m a building owner, and the benchmarking data shows that my building uses a lot of energy or is low-performing. Where can I get help to make it more efficient?","There is an entity in the District called the District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) that serves to help residents, businesses, and institutions save energy and money through energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. DCSEU runs under contract to DOEE, and they are committed to environmental preservation, community engagement, and economic development. Building owners with low-performing buildings should visit <a href='https://www.dcseu.com/' target='_blank'>the DCSEU website</a> for more information or contact them directly at <a href='mailto:info@dcseu.com'>info@dcseu.com</a> or 202-479-2222."
"I have some suggestions for improvements to this site. Where can I send those comments?","The energy benchmarking DC website is currently in beta form, and we certainly welcome any comments from you regarding areas for improvement. You can submit your comments to the benchmarking program directly by emailing <a href='mailto:info.benchmark@dc.gov'>info.benchmark@dc.gov</a> or calling 202-671-3300."
